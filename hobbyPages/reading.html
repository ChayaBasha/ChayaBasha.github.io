                        racism, revenge and the death penalty. The book really highlights the failings of our "injustice" system.

                    <td colspan="3"> When it comes to challenging the status quo that leads to inequity in our society, 
                        it is important to do the hard work. That hard work starts with our own feelings, opinions, biases and experiences. This book 
                        was written by a black woman who does have a black woman's perspective. She interviews other people of color and ultimately I think she truly wants 
                        everyone to feel like they can bring their whole self with them wherever they go including work. In this 
                        day of racial reconing, it is easy to feel uncomfortable, defensive and to shut off and dismiss the truths of others in favor of our own experiences and hardship (the what about me feeling). 
                        Wilkinson reminded me of two important things so far: 1. Each of us can only speak from the perspective we have and can't really say what somebody else's expereince is or has been; 2. We all 
                        are perpetuating a system that keeps those on top on top, even if it is a system that doesn't personally serve us. Honestly, I don't 
                        like some of the language and labels she uses to describe what she is discussing. Her use of terms such as "white supremecy values" or general use of "white people,"
                        I feel is offputting, not very inclusive and undermines her point. I can read past these terms and see her point.

                    <td colspan="3">  My impressions may be very different from others based upon: 1) I have been to New York sveral times, 2) I have had the opportunity to discuss various aspects of my granfather's real lief experiences with him and 3) I read a longer version of the book previously. I would love to discuss the book with others to see what they got out of it. 
                        I really like how the story uses the school in Harlem to bring the characters, who are otherwise living in completely different New Yoyrk's, togethet (the peurto ricans form spanish harlem, the blacks from harlem, the orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, the secular Jews who are teaching and living in suburbia, the wealthy and the poor, the draft dodgers).There is a bit too much sex in the book for my liking and I can poke at 
                        some of he depictions of the orthodox Jews, but the idea of how these different people come together with different motivations and ideas of how to help children who are struggling is an interesting topic.
