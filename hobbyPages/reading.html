                        definitely gave me some things to think about. For example, I am still working on my 10 or less
                        word top level goal.<br><br>Altohugh Duckworth certainly makes some reasonable disclaimers in
                        the book and I feel I must accept that her area of study is what factors lead to high
                        achievement and success, I feel the book definitely falls in a category of perpetuating the
                        American work-a-holic, you are what you do for a living culture. Not everyone needs to have a
                        calling or needs their job to be more than a way to pay the bills. In short the book is good for
                        understanding more about how to cultivate interests into passions and how to strive for work
                        that is your passion and is hard, but I am not sure this is realistics for everyone. I also
                        think it is ok if your "achievements" are small and personal. "I am a good friend who is there
                        for my friends." </td>
