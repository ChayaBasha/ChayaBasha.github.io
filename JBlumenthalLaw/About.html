I started The Young Lawyers Resource Page approximately two years after graduating from law school. 
It was born out of my frustration with the typical law firm way of teaching young associates. 
Time and time again I was set off on a task with a "sink or swim" mentality. 
With little more than examples and time on task, I was expected to get up to speed and provide excellent work. 
<br> </br> It is my hope that this resource page provides a more conducive environment for young lawyers to learn quickly and meaningfuly mcuh of what they will use for the rest of their career.
It provides background information as well as practical guides on various topics. 
This is an ongoing project and new resources are being added regularly. I welcome your feedback.
