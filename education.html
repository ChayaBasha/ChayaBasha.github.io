            <h2 class="key">Post-Secondary Education</h2>
            <p class="details">For those who have been life long Coloradans, it may come as no surprise that I decided
                to
                stay in our beautiful state.</p>

            <h3 class="key">Regis University | 2020-2023</h3>
            <p class="details">After almost 5 years praciticng family law, I decided I needed a change. I enrolled in
                the Fullstack+ graduate certificate at Regis University to see how I liked programming. After completing the
                certificate in October 2020, I decided to continue on to a masters degree in software engineering.</p>

            <h3 class="key"> Medreshet Rachel V'Chaya | 2015</h3>
            <p class="details">After somewhat of a dark night of the soul and with the encouragement and support of the
                Denver based Jewish Experience, in 2015, I spent approximately 6 months attending an orthodox Jewish
                Semenary learning about Jewish law, practice and custom as well as getting a bit better with my hebrew.
            </p>

            <h3 class="key">University of Colorado School of Law | 2009-2012 </h3>
            <p class="details">Somewhere around my early Junior year, I shifted gear and decided to pursue law. Law felt
                like a good fit for someone like me who dreams of serving others and making the world better. I started
                law
                school as a recipient of the Robert C. Byrd Scholarship and graduated in the top 15% of my class. While
                in
                law school, I paritcipated in the 1L Mock Trial Competition, was president of the ACLU student Group,
                was a
                founding memeber of Umbrellagraph and was a student attorney in the Native American Law Clinic.</p>

            <h3 class="key">University of Colorado School of Arts and Sciences | 2006-2009 </h3>
            <p class="details"> Originally hoping to major in cognitive psychology, my freshman year I declared
                psychology
                as my major and had my sights on the cognitive science certificate. Around my second semester or so, a
                wonderful mentor, Sheralee Brindell suggested I double major (I was trying to be cleared to take a
                Philosophy class that was only for majors). In just three years, I graduated with two majors:
                Physchology
                with distinction and Philosophy Magna Cum Laude. I participated in the cognitive psychology club, the
                philosophy club and was the founding president for the literature club (starting the series English and
                ...
                that existed long after I graduated).</p>


            <h2 class="key">Basic Education</h2>
            <p class="details">My K-12 education was completed through the local public schools in Broomfield. One might
                think it is unimportant as an adult to include this information, but I have found that our educational
                foundations often set the trejectory of our life.</p>

            <h3 class="key">Broomfield High School</h3>
            <p class="details">I was a highly involved student. I made the honor roll all four years and completed 5 AP
                classes earning a total of 35 college credits. I participated in student council (as treasurer),
                Natinoal
                Honors Society, was a Link Leader, was in concert band, president of the French Club, played basketabll
                and ran
                track. I graduated second in my class, was the student-elected class speaker and was the recipient of a
                masonic award as well as a DAR good citizenship award.</p>

            <h3 class="key">Broomfield Heights Middle School </h3>
            <p class="details">Middle School was...well...middle school. I continued to enjoy learning. I switched to
                learning French (German wasn't offered), joined student council, was a Web leader, played volleyball and
                basketaball for the school and continued playing the flute. I wrote my first ever Java program on my
                first ever laptop.</p>

            <h3 class="key">Kohl Elementeray </h3>
            <p class="details">Before I was allowed to attend the regular elementeray school for my neighborhood, I had
                to be psychologically evaluated (all because my birthday was a month or so shy of the cut off
                date)...luckily, I
                passed and was able to start First Grade. I loved school already. In my 1st to 5th Grades, I
                participated in
                science fair, German Club, Odessey of the Mind, Basketball, theater and Band.</p>

            <h3 class="key">Child's Adventureland</h3>
            <p class="details"> After two years of pre-school, I was ready to move on to kindergarden, but I was not yet
                the
                "right" age to start Kindergarden at the local elementeray school. As such, my parents decided to enroll
                me in a local
                private Christian school. Although I loved my teacher, Ms. Kelley, in many respects this would end up
                being an
                eye-opening experience for me as the only Jew in attendance.</p>
