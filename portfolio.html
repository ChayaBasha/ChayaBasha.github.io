            <p class="details">Throughout my schooling, I have come to appreciate what Software Engineering is all about
                and despite so many software developers having the titles "software engineer," software engineernig is
                NOT PROGRAMMING it is about the process of creating software from Requirements gathering to maintenance.
                This process requires skills beyond those typical in a programmer. It requires effective communication
                with various types of stakeholders, an
                ability to question what is being developed and a non-tunnel vision (siloughed) view of software
                development. I'd like to see a more expanded view of this in the industry as I truly believe there is
                room for everyone based upon different skill sets. </p>

                <p class="details">In 2013, using the tutorials and information available through W3 schools, I taught
                    myself html and css. This paved the way for me to become the webmaster for other sites. As early as
                    2015, I began taking on the responsibility of updating the content for CS479 on worldclass and at

                <p class="details">In 2020 I decided to get serious about programming and enrolled in Regis Graduate
                    Fullstack+ certificate. My first class, we were using the MEAN stack. This was also my first
                    exposure to Type Script and to front end frameworks. </p>

                        <p class="description">This was my first graduate school project. At the time the class began, I
                            did not know JS or TS or mongo or any of the tools used. I have returned to try to clean
                            things up since then, but would not consider this "finished." <a

                        <p class="description">This was my second class in graduate school where we created a website
                            using Node.JS and JS for the fullstack. The project is in the state it was in for final
                            submission of the 8 week class</p>

                        <p class="description">This project was created as a class exercise to introduce what JS adds to
                            html. The focus was functionality so it isn't super nice looking. I used this little app for
                            another configuration project in 2022.</p>

                </ul>


                <h4 class="details">Java</h4>
                <p class="details"> I actually wrote my first Java program in 2001 in EMACs as a middle schooler. It was
                    cool and I liked it, but also had so many other interests...learning Java would sort of sit on the
                    back burner for me. I began auditing a Java class at Regis in 2018, but due to life challenges had
                    to
                    discontinue until 2020 when I took a formal Java class as part of my masters program.
                <ul class="details">
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/ChayaBasha/FlightGenie">First full Java Project 2020</a>

                        <p class="description">Having taken the Java class certainly made some of my mobile
                            development classes easier.</p>

                            finally understood a better scope for these 8 week class projects. This is probably the most
                            complete of my school projects.</p>

                <h4 class="details">Python</h4>
                <p class="details">Although programmer acquaintenances of mine have long touted the benefits of python,
                    I
                    did not do anyhting with Python until I was asked to teach it for the backend of a web development
                    class
                    in 2021. In all honesty, I did find it a delightful language that was pretty easy to pick up by
                    comparison.

                <h3 class="key"> Configuration and Deployment</h3>
                <p class="details"> Coding and building applications for personal use is great, but ultimately you want
                    to know how to get your work to others. Some of my classes touched on this, but really it wasn't
                    until fullstack labs that I started digging into what is required for deployment. </p>

                <h4 class="details">Remote Servers</h4>
                <p class="details"> For fullstack labs, we worked on how to deploy services to a real metal remote
                    server.

                            with a certificate. Later I did a simlar project with Nginx involving a self-signed

                <h4 class="details">Services</h4>
                <p class="details"> For fullstack labs and for the Research project I did in MSSE 695, I configured
                    several services for the servers. I wrote recipes related to these experiences.
